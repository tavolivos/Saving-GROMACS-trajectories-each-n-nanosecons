# Saving-GROMACS-trajectories-each-n-nanosecons
This script save GROMACS trajectories, independently, each "n" nanoseconds (e.g. each 1, 5, 10 ns, etc.). This is useful to avoid losses when files are damage for any kind of interruptions. It is also possible to restar the simulation from the last ns run.
